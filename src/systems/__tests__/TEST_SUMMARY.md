- **Gesture Comparison**: Similarity scoring and distance calculations
- **Edge Cases**: Empty arrays, single points, timeouts
- **Performance**: Recognition speed and memory usage

### 2. MiracleSystem.test.js
Tests for the miracle casting system including:
- **Initialization**: Miracle definitions and starting state
- **Casting Flow**: Start, update, complete, and cancel casting
- **Resource Management**: Belief point checking and deduction
- **Cooldown Management**: Per-player cooldowns and expiration
- **Active Miracles**: Duration tracking and expiration
- **Miracle Effects**: Healing, buffs, terrain modification
- **Alignment System**: Good/evil miracle impacts
- **Preview System**: Real-time miracle preview
- **Edge Cases**: Invalid inputs, missing data

### 3. GestureMiracleIntegration.test.js
Integration tests for the complete flow:
- **Full Casting Flow**: Gesture → recognition → miracle casting
- **Multiple Players**: Simultaneous casting and independent cooldowns
- **Miracle Interactions**: Overlapping effects and sequential casting
- **Preview Integration**: Real-time preview during gesture drawing
- **Error Handling**: Incomplete gestures, timeouts, cancellation
- **Performance**: Rapid input handling and scaling

### 4. GestureMiraclePerformance.test.js
Performance and stress tests:
- **Gesture Recognition Performance**: 1000+ gestures per second
- **Miracle System Performance**: 100+ simultaneous miracles
- **Memory Usage**: Leak detection and cleanup verification
- **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple players drawing simultaneously
- **Stress Tests**: Spam protection and edge case handling

## Key Test Scenarios

### Unit Test Highlights
1. **Gesture Recognition Accuracy**: Tests all 11 gesture types with various input qualities
2. **Cooldown System**: Verifies independent per-player cooldowns
3. **Resource Management**: Ensures belief points are properly tracked
4. **Alignment System**: Tests good/evil miracle impacts on player alignment

### Integration Test Highlights
1. **End-to-End Flow**: Complete gesture drawing to miracle execution
2. **Multi-Player Support**: Tests simultaneous casting by multiple players
3. **Real-Time Preview**: Validates preview updates during gesture drawing
4. **Error Recovery**: Handles incomplete gestures and timeouts gracefully

### Performance Test Highlights
1. **Recognition Speed**: < 1ms average per gesture recognition
2. **Update Performance**: Handles 100+ active miracles in < 16ms (60fps)
3. **Memory Efficiency**: No memory leaks with repeated operations
4. **Scalability**: Supports 1000+ players with independent cooldowns

## Notable Implementation Details

### Gesture Recognition
- Uses $1 Unistroke Recognizer algorithm
- Normalizes gestures through resampling, rotation, and scaling
- Adjustable thresholds for different gesture types
- Handles noise and imprecise input

### Miracle System
- Modular effect system for easy miracle addition
- Independent cooldown tracking per player
- Real-time preview during gesture drawing
- Alignment system affects available miracles

## Areas for Future Enhancement

1. **Machine Learning**: Could improve gesture recognition accuracy
2. **Combo System**: Chain multiple gestures for powerful miracles
3. **Visual Feedback**: Add particle effects during testing
4. **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjust recognition thresholds based on player skill
5. **Gesture Customization**: Allow players to define custom gestures
